the way to scape scope is creating the variable outside the scope. ({})is scope


('') is defaul when you use variables
("") u can use it when u u have ' in the variable
(``) let us add other things inside by using (${}) its like display inline 



variable is is a container (they can store value)
if statement , if else , else (they create scope)
function let u re-use code (they create scope) u have to add this to print is (function-name();) look at if.html
